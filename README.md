For working with .spc (and associated .set) files from Becker&Hickl photon counting cards.</br>
.spc files are time tagged photon data from imaging experiments where the photon events are stored in a pixel wise format with each pixel containing all of the photon events from that location.</br>
.set files contain the setup files and measurement info for the measurement.</br>
See Becker and Hickl handbook for file formats.</br>
